Codes for the paper ``Long-term causal inference under persistent confounding via data combination'' 

# Description of files
##Code for numerical experiment with GAIN dataset
In the `./real_data/` folder, it contains a `Readme.txt` which describes how to use the codes in that folder to generate Table 1 in the main text as well as Tables 2, 5-9 in the supplement.
##Code for mallest singular values empirical probability matrices
In the `./rank_check/` folder, it contains a `Readme.txt` which describes how to generate Tables 1, 4-5 in the supplement.
##Code for simulation study
In the `./minimax/` folder, it contains a `Readme.txt` which describes how to generate Table 2 in the main text as well as Table 10 in the supplement.
